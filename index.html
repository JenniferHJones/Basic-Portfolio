            <p>Hi, my name is Jennifer but I like to go by JJ. I am a Data Analyst at the Utilities Department at UC
                Davis where I have been working for the last 10 years. However, I have been working on campus in
                various positions since October 2002. At this point in my career, I need to pursue outside education to
                continue to advance. Coding is a field with infinite possibilities as it pertains to all industries.
                While I have limited web development skills at this time, I am eager to acquire the technical expertise
                that will open up new career paths. One of several highly appealing aspects of web development is the
                potential for working remotely. With traffic getting worse all the time and gas prices soaring, I love
                the idea of avoiding a daily commute. </p>
            <p>On a personal note, I am obsessed with the television show <em>The Great British Bake Off</em>, which as
                you probably guessed, is a baking competition. I don't usually care for the personal drama encouraged
                on most reality TV shows. However, this series is filmed in Britain, and they seem to encourage a
                different approach. The contestants may cry because the judges were a little harsh or their bake didn't
                turn out well, but it's never because they were mean to each other. After purchasing one of the
                cookbooks inspired by the show, I have had varying degrees of success and foisted the results on my
                co-workers who have been happy to eat the bakes and give me feedback. Now I just need to find a balance
                between baking and exercise!</p>
